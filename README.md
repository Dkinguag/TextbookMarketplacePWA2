This website is hosted on (Netlify). It is based on the default Gatsby starter, which is made to be easily modifiable. [Demo](https://5e5eaa5c05bcccad950f32eb--jovial-brattain-50b818.netlify.com/)

### 📦 Dynamic Inventory Checking

The Shopify product inventory is being checked in realtime, therefore no rebuilding and redeploy is needed when a product goes out of stock. This avoids problems where products could still be available even though they're out of stock due to redeploy delay.

### 🖌 Styling

I'm using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as styled components library, but the starter is purposely only sparsely styled so you don't have to remove unecessary code but can instead add your own styling immediately.

## ⚠️ Common Problems

- You need to use the Shopify Storefront API credentials not the regular Shopify API.
- You need to have at least one published product on Shopify.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, they recommend starting with [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ⚙️ Building and Hosting

This website is built using [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and hosted on (Netlify)[app.netlify.com/]

## 📌 ToDo

I'll happily merge any pull request to improve the project. 🙂

- [x] Convert Layout to function component.
- [x] Add dynamic inventory checking to avoid re-building after every purchase.
- [x] Add better styling.
- [x] Add image optimization using Gatsby sharp plugin.
- [x] Convert ProductForm to function component.
